```bash
npm test
```

### Deployment

GPA Mate is deployed on Vercel with automatic CI/CD via GitHub Actions.

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Commit your changes and push to the `main` branch for production or `staging` for testing.

2. **Vercel Deployment**:
   - Link your GitHub repository to Vercel.
   - Vercel will automatically build and deploy on every push to the specified branches.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is managed by GitHub Actions, defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
- **Matrix Testing**: Tests across Node.js versions 16, 18, and 20.
- **Security Scanning**: Includes SAST (CodeQL), DAST (Gitleaks), and SCA (Dependabot).
- **Quality Gates**: Ensures all tests and scans pass before deployment.

## Security & Compliance
